# Automated-Petcare-System
Senior Project for Computer Engineering Technology Repository


This is a repository for my senior project during my final year at the university of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.

The main purpose of this repository is to exemplify some of my work to hopeful employers. However, if in some way this code may help you for any reason feel free to use it as a reference, but I do believe that since it was a senior project for the university of Pittsburgh they own the rights to it. 


Very Brief description of project:
The following project was an automated PetCare system. it automatically fed and watered your pets once initially setup. Furthermore, it hosted its own website that could be remotely accessed by the user to do various things: Activate a laser and webcam attached to servos that could be panned/tilted with buttons controlled via the website and from that website the user could also see information about the system such as water and food levels remaining as well as a live webcam feed. The initial concept of the project was simple, automatically feed and provide water to a pet with some user defined parameters. but as you will see the project became more and more advanced as time went on, from adding a texting service that notified the user of low water and food levels to making the watering system completely automated. 

The project was completed by myself and another student, however I was responsible for all coding and web development. the project went on to place second in the senior project design competition that year and was a great success.


Brief Code Description:

Most of the code was written in Python and run via a raspberry pi. everything to do with the functionality of the system itself from user controls, watering, feeding and laser control are all code written in Python. for the website, i used twistd(an event-driven network programming framework written in Python and licensed under the MIT License) & jquery to host and interact with the site and designed the webpage with HTML. I have included the first attempt at the website called indexOriginal and the final version of the website layout called simply index.

This project was a great all-around learning experience it taught me a lot about Linux/raspberry pi and their functionality, the python programming language and all the things needed to develop an interactive website from scratch.


*Please check out the supplementary material in the Flow Charts and Documentation Directory it shows our final documentation describing all the aspects of the project. Also, within the Automated PetCare System Pics there are pictures of the device itself and its components.
